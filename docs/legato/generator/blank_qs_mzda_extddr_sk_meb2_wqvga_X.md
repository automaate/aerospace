## Defining the Architecture

<img src="blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga_arch.png" width="480" height="272" />

In this configuration, the application calls GFX Driver APIs to
initialize the graphics display. These API calls translate into Graphics
LCD (GLCD) driver set up and initialization calls that configure the
GLCD. After the initialization phase, the application transitions into
the paint phase where it draws an image to the frame buffer in external
DDR. The application uses a HAL API to get the start address of the
frame buffer in the DDR and writes the pixel data directly to the
frame buffer memory address.

The GLCD hardware peripheral continuously refreshes the display panel
with data from the frame buffer and the images are shown on the display.

### Demonstration Features 

* GLCD display controller and NANO 2D GPU
* 32-bit RGBA Color Mode Frame Buffer in DDR memory
* RLE compressed RGB image in internal flash

## Creating the Project Graph

<img src="blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga.X_pg.png" width="480" height="272" />

The Project Graph diagram below shows the Harmony components that are included in this application. Lines between components are drawn to satisfy components that depend on a capability that another component provides.

Adding the **PIC32MZ DA Starter Kit BSP** and **Legato Graphics w/ PDA TM4301B Display** Graphics Template component into the project graph will automatically add the components needed for a graphics project and resolve their dependencies. It will also configure the pins needed to drive the external peripherals like the display and the touch controller.

## Building the Application

The parent directory for this application is gfx/apps/legato_quickstart. To build this application, use MPLAB X IDE to open the gfx/apps/legato_quickstart/firmware/legato_qs_mzda_intddr_sk_meb2_tm4301b.X project file.

The following table lists configuration properties:  

| Project Name  | BSP Used |Graphics Template Used | Description |
|---------------| ---------|---------------| ---------|
| blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga.X | PIC32MZ DA Starter Kit | Legato graphics w/ PDA TM4301b Display| Legato graphics on PIC32MZ DA with Internal DDR Starter Kit, MEBII and PDA TM4301b Display. |

> **_NOTE:_**  This application may contain custom code that is marked by the comments // START OF CUSTOM CODE ... and // END OF CUSTOM CODE. When using the MPLAB Harmony Configurator to regenerate the application code, use the "ALL" merging strategy and do not remove or replace the custom code.

## Configuring the Hardware

The final setup should be:

Configure the hardware as follows:
* On the MEB II, the EBIOE and LCD_PCLK (J9) must be jumpered. A
connection establishes the GLCD's pixel clock output timing. The external
SRAM memory on the board is disabled. The jumper (J9) is available on
the bottom side of the MEB II board under the starter kit. The J9
jumper is located on the bottom of the MEB II board, beneath where the
starter kit is plugged into the board. Refer to the following image for
the exact location.
* Connect the PIC32MZ DA Starter Kit board to the MEB II board.
* Power up the board by connecting the power adapter to J3 power
connector on the MEB II board or a powered USB cable to the USB
DEBUG port on the Starter Kit board

Power up the board by connecting the power adapter to J3 power connector on the MEB II board or a powered USB cable to the USB DEBUG port on the Starter Kit board.

## Running the Demonstration

Once the board is powered on, the application will run and show the following image on the display panel.
