The user interface of this application contains dynamic labels that show changing values for systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse rate, very similar to what would be seen on a consumer blood pressure and heartbeat monitor device. The values are simulated and are updated every two seconds when the user touches the screen. A running clock that updates every second is also shown on the screen.
