This application showcases how parallax and sprite animation can be achieved using the aria graphics library. 

The demonstration launches with a splash screen highlighting basic motion capability supported by the graphics library. When running the application, the user can interface with it via capacitive single-fingered touch and swiping gestures. 

The primary mode is presented in a mobile-game like style. 

In addition, two other features demonstrated by this application includes the circular gauge widget and the ability to display updating text at a high update rate (showing the score count). 

The lamb sprite character is animated using more than one hundred frames of animation and is blitted quickly using the GPU and the image preprocessing technique.
