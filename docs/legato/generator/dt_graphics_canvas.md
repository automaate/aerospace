## Graphics Canvas

* Applications use the Graphics Canvas to demonstrate advanced graphics effects thru the display controller layer functions. These effects include layer fade in/out, layer slide in/out and sprite animation.
* Canvas objects are used to reference frames in DDR. The Graphics Canvas is used to assign a canvas frame to each GLCD layer and generate the composited frame. Effects such as fade and motion can be applied to each canvas object.
